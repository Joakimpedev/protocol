## Voice: The Stoic Warrior

- Calm, direct, assumes intelligence
- Complete sentences, natural grammar
- No hype, no apologies, no forced motivation
- States what is true and what to do
- Respects the user's time and mind

Think Marcus Aurelius. Wise, deliberate, clear. Says what needs to be said, nothing more.

## Visual: Terminal-Evolved

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| Headings/Labels | Monospace font |
| Body text | Clean sans-serif |
| Background | Dark, not pure black (~`#0a0a0a`) |
| Text | Off-white, not harsh (~`#e5e5e5`) |
| Accent color | Minimal or none |
| Corners | Sharp, minimal rounding |
| Density | Not afraid of text, readable but dense |

The terminal spirit (structure, monospace, density) without looking like a code editor.

## Copy Rules

**Do:**
- Write complete, natural sentences
- Be direct about what works and why
- State facts, let the user decide
- If something is hard, say it's hard
- If they failed, say they failed - then say to begin again

**Don't:**
- Use emojis
- Use exclamation marks
- Say "great job", "you got this", "amazing"
- Use "bro" or casual slang
- Overcomplicate with medical jargon
- Soften bad news
- Pump them up artificially

## Copy Examples

| Situation | ❌ Not this | ✅ This |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Welcome | "Let's glow up together!" | "What are you looking to improve?" |
| Explaining BHA | "BHA is amazing for your pores!" | "BHA dissolves the oil sitting in your pores. Use it in the morning." |
| Why consistency | "Stay consistent bro!" | "Results come from repetition. Not intensity." |
| Missed a day | "No worries, you got this!" | "You missed yesterday. Start again today." |
| Week complete | "Amazing job! 🎉" | "Week 2 complete." |
| Streak broken | "Don't give up!" | "Streak reset. Begin again." |
| Photo reminder | "Time for your weekly selfie!" | "Same day. Same spot. Same light." |
| Why this works | "Trust the process!" | "Small actions compound. This is how change happens." |
