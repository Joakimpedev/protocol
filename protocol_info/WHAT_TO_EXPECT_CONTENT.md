## Jawline

**Protocol:** Mewing, Chewing Exercises, Low Body Fat, Posture Correction

### Week 1-2
You will likely feel muscle soreness in the tongue, jaw, and neck as you engage underused muscles. You may produce excess saliva. No visible external changes yet.

### Month 1 (Week 3-4)
The "double chin" area may feel slightly tighter or lifted due to the active elevation of the hyoid bone (tongue posture), but this is muscular, not skeletal. Jaw muscles (masseters) may feel firmer to the touch.

### Month 3 (Week 9-12)
Soft tissue adaptation begins. Friends might ask if you have lost weight as the facial muscles tone up and water retention decreases. The jawline appears slightly more defined.

### Month 6+ (Week 25+)
For adults, posture becomes habitual. Visual changes are steady but subtle. While skeletal restructuring is minimal in adults, the maximized muscle tone and corrected posture create the visual effect of a sharper, stronger jaw.

## Acne

**Protocol:** Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Niacinamide, Snail Mucin

### Week 1-2
The "Purge" begins. You may see more breakouts than usual as deep congestion is brought to the surface. Skin may feel dry or tight as it adjusts to the strong actives.

### Week 3-4
Peak purging phase. Breakouts may be inflamed, but this is a sign the protocol is working. Do not stop; consistency is critical here.

### Week 6
The turning point. Active breakouts begin to reduce significantly in frequency. You will notice fewer new pimples forming, though redness from old ones remains.

### Week 12+
Clearance phase. Active acne is largely controlled. Skin texture is smoother, and the focus shifts entirely to healing the leftover red marks (PIE) and scars.

## Oily Skin

**Protocol:** Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid

### Week 1
Skin may feel confused—oily in some zones, dry in others—as it adjusts to the new hydration balance. Niacinamide begins to soothe inflammation immediately.

### Week 2-3
Sebum regulation kicks in. You will notice you need to blot your face less often, and the "midday shine" appears later in the day.

### Week 4-8
Stabilization. Oil production is controlled at the source. Pores appear tighter because they are no longer overflowing with sebum. The skin feels hydrated and soft, rather than greasy.

---

## Dry Skin

**Protocol:** Hyaluronic Acid, Snail Mucin

### Week 1
Immediate relief. Skin feels instantly plumper and less "tight" after application. Note: If you are in a dry climate, ensure you seal these products with a moisturizer, or they may temporarily feel drying.

### Week 2
Barrier repair becomes visible. Flakiness and rough dry patches begin to smooth out. Makeup and sunscreen apply more evenly without clinging to dry spots.

### Month 1+ (Week 4+)
Sustained hydration. The skin barrier is resilient. You no longer feel that painful tightness immediately after washing your face. Fine dehydration lines vanish.

---

## Blackheads

**Protocol:** Salicylic Acid (BHA), Niacinamide

### Week 1-2
The "Loosening" phase. No major visible change yet. The BHA is working deep in the pore to dissolve the "glue" holding the blackhead plugs. Some may purge as small whiteheads.

### Week 4
The "Clean Up." Blackheads appear looser and may wash away effortlessly during cleansing. The "strawberry nose" appearance begins to fade.

### Week 8+
Maintenance. Pores look significantly cleaner and smaller because they are empty. Sebaceous filaments refill much slower than before.

---

## Dark Circles

**Protocol:** Caffeine Solution, Vitamin C, Retinol, Facial Massage

### Week 1
Fluid reduction. You will see an immediate but temporary reduction in puffiness and fluid retention due to the caffeine and massage.

### Month 1+ (Week 4+)
Brightening begins. The skin under the eyes feels slightly stronger and more resilient. The "tired" look improves slightly due to better circulation.

### Month 3-6 (Week 12-26)
Pigment correction. If your dark circles are caused by pigmentation (brown), you will see lightening. Note: If circles are caused by bone structure (hollows), creams will not remove them, but skin quality will improve.

---

## Skin Texture

**Protocol:** AHA, Retinol, Snail Mucin

### Week 1-3
"Retinization." Skin will feel rough, sensitive, and may peel or flake. It often looks duller before it looks brighter. This is the exfoliation process removing dead layers.

### Week 4-6
Acclimatization. Peeling stops. Fresh, new skin cells reach the surface. The skin begins to feel softer to the touch.

### Week 12+
The "Glow." The outer layer of skin is compact and smooth, allowing light to reflect evenly (the "glass skin" effect). Micro-bumps and roughness are gone.

---

## Hyperpigmentation

**Protocol:** Vitamin C, Retinol, AHA

### Week 1-4
The Paradox. Dark spots may appear slightly darker or more defined initially. This is normal as the skin above the pigment is exfoliated away, bringing the spot to the surface.

### Week 8
Fading begins. The edges of dark spots begin to blur. Overall skin tone looks more radiant and even.

### Month 3-6 (Week 12-26)
Significant clearance. Sun spots and post-acne marks fade significantly. Stubborn pigmentation (like melasma) continues to lighten slowly.

---

## Facial Hair

**Protocol:** Minoxidil, Microneedling

### Week 2-4
The Shedding. You may lose some existing facial hair. This is alarming but a positive sign that follicles are resetting for stronger growth.

### Month 2-3 (Week 8-12)
Vellus Phase. "Peach fuzz" (thin, clear, invisible hairs) begins to cover the patchy areas.

### Month 4-6 (Week 16-26)
Transitional Phase. Hairs get darker and thicker but may look "scruffy" or uneven.

### Month 12+ (Week 52+)
Terminal Phase. Hairs become thick, dark, and permanent. Full density is achieved (limited by your genetics).

## Notes

- Week numbers are calculated from signup date (Week 0 = signup week)
- Each week = 7 days from signup
- When `week_end` is `null`, the expectation applies to that week and all subsequent weeks
- Multiple expectations can apply to the same week (e.g., Week 4 might match both a 1-4 range and a 4+ range)
- In such cases, show the most specific match first, or combine relevant expectations
