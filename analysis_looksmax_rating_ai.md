## Design Patterns

### Color Palette
- **Background:** Deep black to very dark purple/navy
- **CTA Gradient:** Purple (#8B5CF6) to orange-red (#EF4444)
- **Notification button:** Blue (visual distinction for system permission)
- **Success:** Green | **Warning:** Yellow | **Error:** Red
- **Text:** White headlines, light gray body, gold for social proof
- **Cards:** Glassmorphism - semi-transparent with subtle borders

### Typography
- Large bold serif/heavy sans-serif headlines
- Clean readable gray body text
- Extra bold large numerals for scores

### Notable Design Choices
- **NO progress bar** - User has no idea they're on step 5 of 14. Prevents feeling the flow is too long
- **NO back navigation** - Entirely forward-moving, no escape hatches
- **NO skip option on most screens** - Only leaderboard and referral have skip
- **Consistent CTA placement** - Always full-width at bottom

## Psychological Techniques

| Technique | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Curiosity Gap** | "You are ?/10" - results calculated but hidden |
| **Sunk Cost** | 14 screens, gender selection, selfie upload, loading wait |
| **Aspirational Imagery** | Every screen has attractive model photos |
| **Social Proof** | "5M+ downloads", "#1 Men's App", fake viral comments |
| **Gamification** | Scores, percentiles, leaderboards, bell curves |
| **FOMO** | "You can be here" at #2, friend rating notifications |
| **Feature Stacking** | 4 separate value preview screens before paywall |
| **Anchoring** | Weekly NOK 99 makes yearly NOK 7.67/week look incredible |
| **Labor Illusion** | Loading screen with scanning animation = perceived thorough analysis |
| **Fabricated Social Proof** | Fake TikTok comments with 92.2K likes |
| **No Escape Hatches** | No progress bar, no back button, no skip on most screens |

## Monetization Approach

### Results-Gated Soft Paywall
- Appears after 13 screens + selfie + analysis loading
- Maximum sunk cost and curiosity at this point
- "You are ?/10" is the ultimate hook

### Pricing Strategy
- **Weekly:** NOK 99/week (~$9.30 USD/week) - anchor price
- **Yearly:** NOK 399/year (NOK 7.67/week, ~$37.50 USD/year) - steered choice
- **Free trial:** 3-day, toggle OFF by default (unusual - may increase direct paid conversions)
- **"SAVE 93%"** green badge on yearly plan
- **"Cancel anytime"** on CTA reduces perceived risk

## Key Takeaways

1. **Longest onboarding (14 screens) = maximum sunk cost** - By paywall, user has invested 2-3+ minutes
2. **Multi-purpose onboarding** - Simultaneously educates, drives viral growth, captures reviews, secures permissions, collects selfie, monetizes
3. **No escape hatches** - No progress bar, no back button, linear funnel with minimal off-ramps
4. **Feature stacking before ask** - 4+ value preview screens justify subscription
5. **Fabricated social proof** - Fake TikTok comments create bandwagon/viral illusion
6. **Gender-tailored** - All imagery matches selected gender
7. **Dark premium glassmorphism** - Purple/neon accents, frosted glass cards, sci-fi aesthetic
8. **Strategic review timing** - Ask before results (and potential disappointment)
9. **Loading as engagement** - Analysis screen builds anticipation and perceived value
10. **Highest downloads (200K/month)** despite being most aggressive - the long funnel works
