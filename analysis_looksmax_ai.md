## Screen-by-Screen Breakdown

### Screen 1: Welcome / Hero (IMG_6566.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Become a Chad with **LooksMax AI**" ("LooksMax AI" in coral/red)
- **Body:** "Take a selfie and get personalized advice on how to become more attractive"
- **Button:** "Get Started" (coral/red)
- **Visual:** Collage of B&W photos of attractive male models in tilted grid
- **Psychology:** Aspirational imagery, internet culture language ("Chad"), low-barrier promise ("take a selfie")

### Screen 2: Feature Preview (IMG_6567.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Take a selfie and get your results"
- **Visual:** Circular profile photo with red curved arrow pointing to rating cards
- **Cards:** Masculinity 9/10 "Top 4%" HIGH (green) | Jawline 4/10 "Below Avg" LOW (red)
- **Third card partially visible** on right edge
- **Button:** "Continue"
- **Psychology:** Show-don't-tell product preview, curiosity gap (mixed scores), gamification (X/10, percentiles), partial reveal hints at more

### Screen 3: Social Proof + Review Request (IMG_6568.PNG)
- **Badge:** "#1 AI Looks App" with laurel wreath
- **Headline:** "Trusted by over 2 million people"
- **Subtext:** "Be a chad and leave a review" (handshake emoji)
- **Button:** "Leave a Review"
- **Visual:** Line-art illustration of phone with star + tapping hand
- **Psychology:** Social proof (2M users), authority positioning (#1), identity-based persuasion ("be a chad and review"), early rating capture

### Screen 4: Tracking Permission / ATT (IMG_6569.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Personalize Your LooksMax Experience"
- **Body:** "We need your permission to use your app activity to make LooksMax AI incredibly personalized for you"
- **Icon:** Moai emoji (looksmaxxing/mewing culture symbol)
- **Buttons:** "Allow" (coral/red) / "Skip" (text link)
- **Psychology:** Benefit-framing ("personalize" not "track"), cultural signaling (Moai), soft skip option

### Screen 5: Notification Permission (IMG_6570.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Allow Notifications"
- **Body:** "Get notified when your friends get their ratings & when we launch new features"
- **Icon:** Golden 3D bell emoji
- **Buttons:** "Enable Notifications" (coral/red, bell emoji) / "Maybe Later"
- **Psychology:** Social FOMO triggers, "Maybe Later" implies temporary delay not rejection

### Screen 6: Invite Code (IMG_6571.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Got an invite code?"
- **Body:** "Enter it below if you've got one, otherwise skip ahead"
- **Icon:** Pink "ADMIT ONE" ticket emoji
- **Input:** Placeholder "ABCDE"
- **Buttons:** "Enter Code" / "Skip"
- **Psychology:** Exclusivity/velvet rope effect, viral loop, no-pressure approach

### Screen 7: Paywall (IMG_6572.PNG)
- **Headline:** "Get your **rating**" ("rating" in green)
- **Subhead:** "Become more attractive with personalized advice from LooksMax"
- **3 Rating Cards:**
  - Jawline 9/10, Top 2%, HIGH (green) + bell curve + advice: "Keep a clean shave"
  - Hairline 7/10, Top 35%, MID (yellow) + bell curve + advice: "Use minoxidil"
  - Skin 3/10, Top 87%, LOW (red) + bell curve + advice: "Moisturizers for dry skin"
- **Price:** "NOK 49,00 per week"
- **CTA:** "Get your results" (GREEN button with eyes emoji - color shift from coral!)
- **"Maybe Later"** dismissal
- **Footer:** Cancel Anytime - Terms - Restore
- **Pagination dots** (2 pages)
- **Psychology:** Bell curve statistical framing, mix of high/low scores is credible, actionable advice preview, weekly pricing, green CTA signals "go"/growth, loss aversion after 6 screens invested

## Psychological Techniques

| Technique | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Aspirational Identity** | "Become a Chad", model photos, transformation promise |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Sample results shown, YOUR results withheld until paywall |
| **Social Proof** | "2 million people", "#1 AI Looks App", laurel wreath |
| **Gamification** | X/10 scores, percentiles, bell curves, color-coded labels |
| **Social Comparison** | Bell curves, "Top 4%", "Below Avg" |
| **Subculture Signaling** | Moai emoji, "Chad" language, looksmaxxing vocabulary |
| **Pre-Permission Priming** | Custom screens before system dialogs |
| **Soft Friction** | Skip/Maybe Later on all permission screens |
| **Loss Aversion** | 6 screens invested before paywall |
| **Color Psychology** | Green CTA on paywall = "go"/growth |
| **Weekly Pricing** | NOK 49/week sounds small (~$234/year) |
